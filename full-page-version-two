		<h2>Ways to Practice Self-Compassion</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Comfort your body</strong></li>
				<p><em>Eat something healthy. Lie down and rest. Massage your own neck, feet, or hands. Take a walk. Anything you can do to improve how you feel physically gives you a dose of self-compassion.</em></p>
			<li><strong>Write a letter to yourself</strong></li>
				<p><em>Think of a situation that caused you to feel pain (a breakup with a lover, a job loss, a poorly received presentation). Write a letter to yourself describing the situation, but without blaming anyone â€” including yourself. Use this exercise to nurture your feelings.</em></p>
			<li><strong>Give yourself encouragement</strong></li>
				<p><em>Think of what you would say to a good friend if he or she was facing a difficult or stressful situation. Then, when you find yourself in this kind of situation, direct these compassionate responses toward yourself.</em></p>
			<li><strong>Practice mindfullness</strong></li>
				<p><em>Even a quick exercise, such as meditating for a few minutes, can be a great way to nurture and accept ourselves while we're in pain.</em></p>
